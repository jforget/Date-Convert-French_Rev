Todo list: mainly play the CPANTS game.

In late October 2013, the CPANTS rating of Date::Convert::French_Rev
was 103.33 (core kwalitee 83.33). Fails include:

-- several fails caused by the absence of META.yaml
-- POD errors
-- list of prerequisites
-- use warnings
-- separate LICENSE file
-- two experimental fails for Fedora
-- being a prerequisite for another module.

The 0.06 version aims to remove all these issues except for the Fedora
issues and  for being a prerequisite.   But if some  issues remains or
appears, the 0.07 issue will remove them.

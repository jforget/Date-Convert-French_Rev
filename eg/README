This directory  contains a  few examples of  program using  the French
Revolutionary calendar module. There are:

today -- the name says it all.  Typically called from your .profile.

prt_cal -- to generate a HTML file, containing the calendar for a given
French Revolutionary year.

g2r_table -- to generate a HTML  file, which will give a few tables to
convert  a  Gredorian  date  into  a French  Revolutionary  date.  The
instructions for use are included.

r2g_table -- the opposite of g2r_table.

labels_* -- auxiliary files, used by prt_cal, g2r_table and r2g_table,
for language-dependant values, especially the instructions for use.
labels_fr contains the French translations of the pod documentations
which are in prt_cal, g2r_table and r2g_table.

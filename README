Date::Convert::French_Rev - Jean Forget <J-FORGET@wanadoo.fr>

Date conversion using the French Revolutionary calendar.

This module is a add-on to Mordechai Abzug's Date::Convert
module. Since his module is pre-alpha, mine is, too.

REQUIREMENTS

Date::Convert, by Mordechai Abzug (MORTY)
Roman, by OZAWA Sakuro (OZAWA)

INSTALL

First intall Roman.pm and Date::Convert.pm, and then install the
normal way:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

Note: if "make test" give you a "dubious" result, one possibility is
that you have forgotten to install Roman.pm. I know, it happened to
me!

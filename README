Date::Convert::French_Rev - Jean Forget <JFORGET@cpan.org>

Date conversion using the French Revolutionary calendar.

WHY A NEW VERSION AFTER TEN YEARS?

I  released the  last version  of this  module (0.05)  the same  day I
released DateTime::Calendar::FrenchRevolutionary  version 0.01. It was
intended to be the final version of Date::Convert::French_Rev.  So why
do I release another version ten years later?

Between  2003 and  2013, the  world has  moved on  and CPAN  has moved
on.  In  2003, UTF-8  was  a promising  technic,  but  not yet  widely
used. In  2013, UTF-8 *is*  widely used. In  2003, there was a  set of
CPAN  best  practices:  test   scripts  in  t/*.t  for  example.  Some
recommanded practices appeared later: META.yml for example. And CPANTS
was  created  to  provide   a  static  code  analysis  checking  these
recommanded practices. So  this new version is also  meant to catch up
with these  recommanded practices. In  other words, I play  the CPANTS
game and I try to improve my rating by updating this module.

PRESENTATION

This   module  is   a  add-on   to  Mordechai   Abzug's  Date::Convert
module.  Since  his  module  is  pre-alpha,  mine  is,  too.   Another
consequence is that  this module allows you to convert  from or to any
calendar implemented in  Date::Convert.  These calendars are currently
Gregorian, Julian,  Hebrew and absolute  (which is Julian  Day Number,
with midnight-to-midnight days instead of noon-to-noon).

This module allows you to pretty-print French Revolutionary dates.

You can use this module even if you do not have Perl on your computer.
See the alternate install procedure below.

REQUIREMENTS

Roman, by Alexandr Ciornii (CHORNY)
Date::Convert, by Mordechai Abzug (MORTY)
Test::Exception, by Adrian Howard (ADIE)

INSTALL

First intall Test::Exception,  Roman.pm and Date::Convert.pm, and then
install the normal way:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

Note: if "make  test" give you a "dubious"  result, one possibility is
that you  have forgotten to install  Roman.pm. I know,  it happened to
me!

Or use you favorite CPAN client: CPAN.pm, cpanp, cpanm, dzil, whatever.

ALTERNATE INSTALL

This module can be installed on a perl-less computer!

All you need, on this computer, is:
  - tar and gzip, or compatible software
  - a table-aware HTML browser (no Internet connection required if you
  downloaded the archive from a local network or a CD-ROM)
  - a printer.

The installation steps are:

- Gunzip and untar the archive.
- Go to the eg/result subdirectory.
- Open the various files ending in "en.html" (or, if you are a
French-speaker, ending in "fr.html") with the HTML browser.
- Print them.
That's all!

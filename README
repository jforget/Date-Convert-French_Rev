Date::Convert::French_Rev - Jean Forget <J-FORGET@wanadoo.fr>

Date conversion using the French Revolutionary calendar.

This   module  is   a  add-on   to  Mordechai   Abzug's  Date::Convert
module.  Since  his  module  is  pre-alpha,  mine  is,  too.   Another
consequence is that  this module allows you to convert  from or to any
calendar implemented in  Date::Convert.  These calendars are currently
Gregorian, Julian,  Hebrew and absolute  (which is Julian  Day Number,
with midnight-to-midnight days instead of noon-to-noon).

This module allows you to pretty-print French Revolutionary dates.

You can use this module even if you do not have Perl on your computer.
See the alternate install procedure below.

REQUIREMENTS

Date::Convert, by Mordechai Abzug (MORTY)
Roman, by OZAWA Sakuro (OZAWA)

INSTALL

First intall Roman.pm and Date::Convert.pm, and then install the
normal way:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

Note: if "make  test" give you a "dubious"  result, one possibility is
that you  have forgotten to install  Roman.pm. I know,  it happened to
me!

ALTERNATE INSTALL

This module can be installed on a perl-less computer!

All you need, on this computer, is:
  - tar and gzip, or compatible software
  - a table-aware HTML browser (no Internet connection required if you
  downloaded the archive from a local network or a CD-ROM)
  - a printer.

The installation steps are:

- Gunzip and untar the archive.
- Go to the eg/result subdirectory.
- Open the various files ending in "en.html" (or, if you are a
French-speaker, ending in "fr.html") with the HTML browser.
- Print them.
That's all!

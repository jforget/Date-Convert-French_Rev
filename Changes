Revision history for Perl extension Date::Convert::French_Rev.

0.06  Octidi 18 Brumaire CCXXII, jour de la dentelaire (Friday 2013-11-08, also
      the 214th anniversary of Bonaparte's coup agains the Directory)
        - kwalitee issues: license, style, META.{yml,json}
        - use UTF-8 instead of ISO-8859-1, use spaces instead of tabs
        - more tests, more modern tests

0.05  Nonidi 9 Floréal CCXI, jour de la jacinthe (Monday 2003-04-28)
        - last version compatible with Date::Convert, next one will
        be in the DateTime::Calendar namespace, compatible with DateTime.pm
        - I had always believed that the additional days were not called
        Primidi, Duodi etc. But I have found a document where they are
        called Primidi etc. The bug in the module is fixed.

0.04  Tridi 13 Fructidor CCX, jour de l'épine-vinette (Friday 2002-08-30)
	- reorganise the directory structure along Matt Sergeant's tips
        - include the 4000-modulus rule for leap years (according to emacs-21.2)
        - reorganise the absolute -> FR conversion
	- rephrase the README file
	- add the  prerequisite for Date::Convert  in Makefile.PL (the
	use statement and the @ISA array are not sufficient)
        - add a few examples in the eg/ subdirectory
	- fix a few bugs: $_ was squashed by date_string, the month value
	was not checked
	- compatibility with diagnostics-1.2

0.03  Décadi 20 Thermidor CCIX, jour de l'écluse (Tuesday 2001-08-07)
        - rewrite the Changes file, with proper dates
        - it seems that the 4th additional day should rather be "jour
	de l'opinion"
	- reformat the code
